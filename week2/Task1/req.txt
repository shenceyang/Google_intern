Task1
Use EventEmitter to build the base lifecycle model, such as onCreate onUpdate onDestroy,
with one message at each stage console.log respectively。

For example, let's build a shopping cart management EventEmitter.
Initialize the shopping cart at onCreate by calling a function that adds an entry to the 
object Array in the shopping cart that contains: { name:'', price:.0, amout:0 }

Adding entries to the maintained object Array cart.add(name, price, amount)，and this 
function will trigger onUpdate，to report the information and quantity of items in the 
current shopping cart

Triggers onDestroy on exit to output the total price of the items in the cart.
